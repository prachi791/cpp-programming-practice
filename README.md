<p>

This repository contains my C++ practice programs written as part of regular coding and problem-solving. The programs are mostly <b>scenario-based</b> and are numbered (program1, program2, etc.) to match their intended sequence and context.

</p>



<h2>Purpose</h2>



<p>

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of core C++ concepts through hands-on practice. I focus on writing clear and logical solutions while gradually improving code structure and readability as I learn.

</p>



<h2>How the programs are organized</h2>



<p>

Programs are written as <b>Program 1, Program 2, Program 3</b>, and so on, because each program represents a distinct scenario or problem statement. To maintain clarity, each file includes comments at the top describing:

</p>

<ul>

&nbsp; <li>The scenario or problem being solved</li>
&nbsp; <li>The main concepts used (for example: classes, objects, loops)</li>

</ul>


&nbsp;
<p>

Folders are used to group related concepts, keeping the repository easy to navigate.

<h2>Learning approach</h2>



<p>

I treat this repository as a practice log. Programs are not rushed or copied; they are written to build logic and confidence. As my understanding improves, earlier programs may be revisited and refined.
